## üìÑ Abstract
As labor dispatch becomes increasingly widespread, enterprises face serious challenges such as r√©sum√© fraud, low background verification efficiency, and heightened data breach risks‚Äîespecially under growing regulatory pressures. Existing solutions, such as centralized HR systems and third-party verification platforms, may improve efficiency to some extent, but still suffer from issues including a lack of transparency, susceptibility to data tampering, and cumbersome verification procedures. These limitations highlight a significant research gap in balancing efficiency, privacy, and trust.
This study aims to develop a secure, automated, and regulation-compliant labor dispatch management system that enhances the credibility, efficiency, and privacy protection in r√©sum√© verification.
To address these issues, we propose a blockchain-based labor dispatch system that integrates smart contracts for automated credential validation and incorporates Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) to reinforce data ownership and control. Leveraging the immutability and decentralization of blockchain, the system ensures secure contract storage and auditability, while an access control mechanism effectively mitigates unauthorized data access risks.
Our research involves the development of a prototype system, evaluated based on key performance indicators such as transaction processing time, verification latency, data integrity, and security.
The contributions of this study include:
(1) Credential certification of personal data ensures the authenticity of r√©sum√©s, improving recruitment efficiency;
(2) Secure contract storage on the blockchain satisfies both business confidentiality and legal compliance requirements;
(3) A robust access control mechanism effectively safeguards sensitive personal data, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches;
(4) The construction and performance evaluation of a blockchain-based labor dispatch system prototype addressing key operational metrics.
Compared to existing technologies, the proposed model demonstrates signifi-cant advantages in trustworthiness, efficiency, and data protection and shows strong potential for practical deployment in highly regulated industry environ-ments.
